# EXI User Guide

EXI can be used in creating a shipment. Creating a shipment in EXI with a complete list of Unipucks and samples can also be synched to MXCuBE and connection sample information and associated data.

## Logging to EXI

Users with a scheduled beamtime at the facility can log in to EXI at any time so create a shipment.

* Log in with your DOOR account credentials.
* Click on **"Sessions"** menu item.
* Click on **"Choose a period of time"** and select a time slot with your beamtime, if you can't see your proposal in the table.
* Select the proposal you want to work with. Make sure you work with the proposal with scheduled beamtime. Sample information entered under the wrong proposal cannot be accessed during the experiment.

## Create a shipment
The next steps are to generate the ID and shipping labels for your dewars, list the containers and samples in the dewars and send a notification to the facility staff. Even if you plan to transport the dewars to the facility yourself, creating the shipment is useful to provide the required sample information to be used in synching to MXCuBE.

* From the **"Shipment"** drop down menu, select **"Shipments"** and **"Add new"**.

* Fill in the shipment form. This information will be shown in the two ID labels generated by EXI to easily identify your dewar when it arrives and departs the facility and while it is present at the beamline. *Note:* Even if you are using your own shipping labels, or bringing the dewar to the facility yourself, it is important to attach the ID label to the dewar to avoid misidentification.
    * The **Name** field entry will appear in the shipment list and the ID labels and it must be unique for the proposal. We recommend a name containing the date of the experiment.
    * The **Session** menu allows selection between the beamtimes associated with selected proposal and needs to be chosen.
    * Select from the **From** drop down menu your name or other contact person in your home lab responsible for the shipment.
    * Usually the **Return address** will be the *“Same as for shipping to the beamline”* (default), but you may choose a different one.
    * Save the entered information.

## Edit shipment
If you wish to review or edit the information after saving the form, select **List** under **Shipments** in the **Shipment** dropdown menu.

That will show a list of your shipments in the left side of the window in inverse order of creation (you might need to refresh the page to show the newly created shipment). Click anywhere on the shipment card to open the shipment information.

## Create new samples and provide a sample list
This section describes how to enter information about the parcels, containers and samples present in the shipment. Adding the parcels must be done in order to generate the shipping label for the dewars, as described in the [Send the Shipment to DESY](#send-the-shipment-to-DESY). However, filling up the sample details can be done while the dewars are in transit or even when they are already at the facility. Once the Unipucks are loaded in the sample changer dewar (shipment status set to “processing”) it will not be possible to change the shipment contents any longer.
