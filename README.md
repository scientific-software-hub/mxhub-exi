# EXI

**EXI** (Extended ISPyB Interface) is an advanced and user-friendly web application designed for synchrotron facilities. EXI is primarily used in synchrotron facilities involved in macromolecular crystallography (MX) but is adaptable for other experimental techniques supported by ISPyB. It ease critical research in structural biology, drug discovery and materials science by ensuring that the experimental process is smooth and data-driven. 

It is the interface for researchers, scientists and facility staff to plan, execute and monitor experiments, as well as to manage and analyze data.

## The Relationship Between EXI and ISPyB
EXI extends the capabilities of **ISPyB** (Information System for Protein Crystallography Beamlines), a powerful backend database system. ISPyB functions as a backend for storing and managing experimental metadata and results, EXI serves as the accessible interface through which users interact with this data.

## Key Features of EXI
- Experiment Planning: tools for inputting and managing sample information, including container and crystal details.
- Experiment Monitoring: visualization of collected data and experiment results in real-time.
- Data Management: access to experimental data stored in ISPyB, tools to organize, search, and retrieve datasets.
- User-friendly Interface: a clean and responsive design that simplifies navigation.
- Role-based permissions to ensure data security and integrity.
